## Contributing 

Contributions to this library are welcomed. Any contributions have to meet the following criteria:

* Meaningfulness. Discuss whether what you are about to contribute indeed belongs to this library in the first place before submitting a pull request.
* Code style. Follow our [Swift style guide](https://github.com/qvik/swift) 100%.
* Stability. No code in the library must ever crash; never place *assert()*s or implicit optional unwrapping in library methods.
* Testing. Every util method, function and extension in the library must have unit tests, preferably triggering both successful and unsuccessful calls. All custom views/controls should have proper documentation and usage examples.
* Logging. No production code in the library must write logs. Unit tests may output logs.

### Submit your code

All merges to the **master** branch go through a *Merge ('pull') Request* and MUST meet the above criteria.

In other words, follow the following procedure to submit your code into the library:

* Clone the library repository
* Create a feature branch for your code
* Code it, clean it up, test it thoroughly
* Make sure all your methods meant to be public are defined as public
* Push your branch
* Create a merge request

## Updating the pod

As a contributor you do not need to do this; we'll update the pod whenever needed by projects.

* Update QvikUi.podspec and set s.version to match the upcoming tag
* Commit all your changes, merge all pending accepted *Merge ('pull') Requests*
* Create a new tag following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/); eg. `git tag -a 2.2.0 -m "Your tag comment"`
* `git push --tags`
* `pod repo push qvik-podspecs QvikUi.podspec`

Unless already set up, you might do the following steps to set up the pod repo:

* ```pod repo add qvik-podspecs https://github.com/qvik/qvik-podspecs.git```
